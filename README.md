# 🎓 University Progression Prediction System  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **Python-based system** that helps universities track student progression based on their **credit scores**. The program prompts users to enter student credits, calculates total credits, and categorizes their academic progress. It also provides **histograms for visualization**, stores data in a text file, and utilizes a **dictionary for efficient data handling**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **User Input Handling** – Prompts users to enter credits  
✅ **Total Credit Calculation** – Determines the student's total credits  
✅ **Progression Classification** – Categorizes students into Progress, Trailer, Retriever, or Excluded  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Uses **histograms** to represent student progression trends  
✅ **List & File Storage** – Stores student records in a text file for future reference  
✅ **Dictionary Usage** – Efficiently manages student data  

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. **User Inputs Credits** – Enter module credits.  
2. **Calculate Total Credits** – The system verifies if the total credits are valid.  
3. **Determine Progression Outcome** – Based on total credits, the student falls into:  
   - 🎉 **Progress** – Ready to move forward  
   - 🟡 **Trailer** – Close to progressing but needs minor improvements  
   - 🔄 **Retriever** – Must retake some modules  
   - ❌ **Excluded** – Unable to continue the course  
4. **Display Histogram** – Shows the count of students in each category.  
5. **Store & Print Data** – Saves student records in a text file and dictionary for easy retrieval.
